Q11.In functional testing each and every component  of webpage   tested against the require documents.
There are 5 types of functional testing
3 genral
1. under testing : in this very less inputs should be given and prrformed testing.
2.over testing:giving reputed inputs and preform  testing eg. amount=1-50000
1,2,3,4,5,6,7..............................500000

3.optimise approach: Here we carefully give the inputs it is not repeated in nature.
eg.amount=1-50,0000
1 lower limit- starting point -1

1 decimal value-100.50

2 additional
1.positive testing: here we give only valid inputs  according to requirement documents.
2.Negative testing: here we give invalid inputs against the requirement documents.
